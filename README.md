Discrete Stochastic Search for Deep Relational Machines

#### Info

This repo contains the state-of-the-art results from papers: ILP 2018 and ICANN 2019. The works are related, and therefore it is okay to post it in one place. 

#### The result file

It contains results from the following papers:

Gustav Sourek, Vojtech Aschenbrenner, Filip Zelezn√Ω, Ondrej Kuzelka:
Lifted Relational Neural Networks. CoCo@NIPS 2015

Tirtharaj Dash, Ashwin Srinivasan, Lovekesh Vig, Oghenejokpeme I. Orhobor, Ross D. King:
Large-Scale Assessment of Deep Relational Machines. ILP 2018: 22-37

Tirtharaj Dash:
XGB with Relational Features. Unpublished. (This experiment was done just for fun and never intended to publish.)

Tirtharaj Dash, Ashwin Srinivasan, Ramprasad S. Joshi, A. Baskar:
Discrete Stochastic Search and Its Application to Feature-Selection for Deep Relational Machines. ICANN (2) 2019: 29-45

#### Note

The first 3800 features of each dataset were used to roughly match the ILP2018. However, there is no such restriction if you take all features.
